# Django Rest Framework Backend template Project  using Docker

This is a Django Rest Framework template project that uses Docker to manage the development and **production** environment. Additionally, it includes configuration for Dockerizing the database.

## Prerequisites

Before starting to use this project, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

```

## Project Configuration

1. Configure the environment variables of the project. To do this, modify the variables found in the following files:

```
    ├── .env
    │   └── .django (django enviroment settings)
    │   └── .postgres (postgres enviroment settings)
```

2. Build and start the Docker containers:

   The Django image automatically applies Django migrations and creates a superuser with the credentials that are specified in the .env/.django file.


```
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml build
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

## Usage
After configuring the project, you can access the web application in your browser at http://localhost:8001`.

To access the Django command line inside the Docker container, execute the following command:

To view the name of the Django project container:
```
docker ps
```

With the name of the Django project, run the following command:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml exec -it django_container_name python manage.py shell
```

To **stop** the Docker containers, execute the following command:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml build down
```

# 'Setup' App for Automatic Configurations

This Django app, named setup, serves the purpose of automating and streamlining tasks that might otherwise be tedious and unnecessary. It automates the process of registering models with the Django admin site, eliminating the need for manual registration. By iterating through the models defined in your project's applications, this app seamlessly registers them with the admin site. This ensures that models are readily displayed and can be managed within the admin interface. The primary objective is to offload routine administrative tasks, enabling you to focus on more essential aspects of your project
